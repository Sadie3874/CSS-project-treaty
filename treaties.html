        <h2>What is a treaty?</h2>

        <p>
          A treaty is an agreement between nations, In Canada it is an agreement between the
          Goverment and the Indigenous poeple. Most of the time the treatys were made to share land
          or be able to cross the Indigenous peoples land along with usesing some resorces. In
          return the Indigenous people got more land or more resorces.
