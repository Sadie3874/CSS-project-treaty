          <h2 class="middle">What is a Treaty?</h2>

          <p>
            A treaty is an agreement between nations, In Canada it is an agreement between the
            Government and the Indigenous people. Most of the time the treaties were made to share
            land or be able to cross the Indigenous peoples land along with using some resources. In
            return the Indigenous people got more land or more resources.

        <h2 class="middle">The Numbered Treaties</h2>
        <p>
          The numbered treaties are 11 treaties that stretch from Ontario to British Columbia. The
          numbered Treaties are agreements between the Indigenous peoples and the Crown. The
          Treaties gave the crown more land and in return the Indigenous people would get hunting
          and fishing tools, annual salary, farming supplies, land etc.

        <h2 class="middle">Points of View</h2>
        <p>
          An important thing to know is that the Crown and the Indigenous people viewed Treaties
          very differently, to the Indigenous people they saw the treaties as an agreement between
          nations vs the Crown saw treaties to get more land and power. Because of how the Crown
          viewed the Treaties many of the agreements between the 2 nations where never fulfilled. A
          lot of land that was promised to the Indigenous people was never given and are fighting to
          get the land to this day.
