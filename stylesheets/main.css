  Color theory 
  I chose the cream color as my main color because it shows goodness and humility treaties are about an 
  agreement between different nations and white shows that, white also means the opposite in other cultures, 
  and that is what happened to some of the treaties, is that promises that came with the treaty never came 
  and at is important that we know what treaties are because they make up Canada. 
  My secondary color is a dark marron color, this makes the content that needs to be read first pop out. 
  Red means excitement, energy, and action. I wanted my website to have a fun but serious feel to it
  and red means excitement and marron is both red and brown and brown means earth and the indigenous 
  people lived on this land, and they have a deep connection with the earth so this gives the website 
  a sense of fun but serious to it.  The green is the other secondary color. It gives all important elements
  a highlight to it so users will too to it, green means growth, health, and money. I chose this because we
  need to grow as a country and learn from our past mistakes, so that we will carry on with good relationships
  in the future. Out of the treaties Britain got lot of money out of it cause they were able to build the
  Canadian pacific Railway, but money can mean some other things to people the Indigenous people saw the
  treaties as a friends ship and an agreement with nations that will last forever, so they saw the
  worth of the treaties in another way then Britain. 

  Triadic color scheme: the colors is used are in the triadic color scheme, 
  they are almost directly across from one another on the color wheel,
  the shade might be a bit different but they are almost directly across. 


  font family: I chose this font family beacuse the serif font family gives a trustworthy and traditional feel to it, it also 
  looks more reliable and established. i chose this cause treaties are very serious and mean alot
  to people so i wanted to go for a more serious feel but also have a trustworthy look to it too.
