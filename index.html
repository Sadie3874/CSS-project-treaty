          Treaty 3 maintains all rights to water and land all though Manitoba and Ontario. The
          Treaty also said that the British could build a railway(Canadian Pacific Railways/CPR)
          through their land. The Indigenous People got 55,000 square miles and was shared with the
          british. Before the treaty was signed, the land was going to be the first-post
          confederation treaty, But the Anishinaabe people didnt want their lands to be taken over.
          The Goverment of Canada also gave family of 5 $12 dollars a year or $5 dollars a person.
          The treaty also set aside reserves for the Ojibwe people.
