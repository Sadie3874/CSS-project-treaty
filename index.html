        <h2>What is a treaty?</h2>

        <p>
          a treaty is an agreement between nations, In Canada it is an agreement between the
          Goverment and the Indigenous poeple. Most of the time the treatys were made to share or be
          able to cross the Indigenous peoples land along with usesing some resorces. In return the
          Indigenous people got more land or more resorces

        <h2>What is a treaty 3?</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 3 is located in easteren lower Canada and goes into ontario. Treaty 3 is also
          located on the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe land, Treaty 3 was created in 1873 because the
          britsih wanted a route form Fort Garry and Fort William.
        </p>

        <h2>Agreements in the treaty</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 3 maintins all rights to water and land all though Manitoba and Ontario The Treay
          also said that the British could build a railway through their land. The Indigenous People
          got 55,000 square miles and was shared with the british. Before the treaty was signed, the
          land was going to be the first-post confederation treaty, But the Anishinaabe people didnt
          want their lands to be taken over. The Goverment of Canada also gave family of 5 $12
          dollars a year. The treaty also set aside reserves for the Ojibwe people.
