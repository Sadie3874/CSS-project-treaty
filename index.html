      <h2>Agreements in the Treaty</h2>
      <p>
        Treaty 3 maintains all rights to water and land all though Manitoba and Ontario. The Treaty
        also said that the British could build a railway(Canadian Pacific Railways/CPR) through
        their land. The Indigenous People got 55,000 square miles and was shared with the british.
        Before the treaty was signed, the land was going to be the first-post confederation treaty,
        But the Anishinaabe people didnt want their lands to be taken over. The Goverment of Canada
        also gave family of 5 $12 dollars a year or $5 dollars a person. The treaty also set aside
        reserves for the Ojibwe people.
